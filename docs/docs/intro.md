# Introduction

> **Looking for Chinese docs?** [中文文档点此进入](https://BotRunner64.github.io/Teleopit/zh-Hans/)

**Teleopit** is a lightweight, extensible whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots. It provides real-time motion retargeting from human operators to Unitree G1 robots, supporting both MuJoCo simulation and real hardware deployment.

## Key Features

- **Offline sim2sim**: Play back BVH motion capture files through RL policy in MuJoCo
- **VR teleoperation**: Real-time whole-body control via Pico 4 / Pico 4 Ultra full body tracking
- **Sim2real deployment**: Deploy to Unitree G1 hardware with the same pipeline
- **Training pipeline**: Motion-tracking training with General-Tracking-G1 plus independent RL-only G1 ladder climbing
- **Extensible design**: Protocol-based components (InputProvider, Retargeter, Controller, Robot)

## Pipeline Overview

```text
